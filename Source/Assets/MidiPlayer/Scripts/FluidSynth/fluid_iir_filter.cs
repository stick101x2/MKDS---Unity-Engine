  CHANGES
    - Adapted for Unity, Thierry Bachmann, March 2020

 * Applies a low- or high-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency and quality factor
 * for a given biquad transfer function:
 *          b0 + b1*z^-1 + b2*z^-2
 *  H(z) = ------------------------
 *          a0 + a1*z^-1 + a2*z^-2
 *
 * Also modifies filter state accordingly.
 * @param iir_filter Filter parameter
 * @param dsp_buf Pointer to the synthesized audio data
 * @param count Count of samples in dsp_buf
 */
/*
 * Variable description:
 * - dsp_a1, dsp_a2: Filter coefficients for the the previously filtered output signal
 * - dsp_b0, dsp_b1, dsp_b2: Filter coefficients for input signal
 * - coefficients normalized to a0
 *
 * A couple of variables are used internally, their results are discarded:
 * - dsp_i: Index through the output buffer
 * - dsp_centernode: delay line for the IIR filter
 * - dsp_hist1: same
